            <p>It is my lifelong dream to become a software developer and to create significant impacts by solving challenging problems. I constantly yearn to be part of the amazing projects that developers around the world are working on and to collaborate on the future that is being built.</p>

            <p>So far, in this quest to make my dream a reality, I have acquired the working knowledge of multiple programming languages, frameworks, and databases under my belt. I also did an internship at Kaylin Technologies Pvt. Ltd, and apprenticeships at LCS and Rasvel's where I had hands-on experience developing databases and websites. Furthermore, I have built multiple games, websites, web applications, databases, animation effects, mass email senders, and GUIs along the way with agile teams. Currently pursuing post-graduation in Full Stack Software Development at Lambton college and being the go-to guy for tech-related doubts of my peers.</p>

Looking for opportunities that can expedite my journey and always happily available anytime on
